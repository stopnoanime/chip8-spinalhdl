# CHIP-8 roms

I don't own any of these roms.

Use the rom_to_hex.cpp utility to convert multiple roms into a single ASCII hex file. Then you need to write the hex values into a sd card with no filesystem.
If you are on Windows you can use HxD to achive this.

## rom_to_hex usage:

`rom_to_hex.exe file1 <file2-256> `
